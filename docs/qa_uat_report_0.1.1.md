# QA & UAT Report for 0.1.1

## Overview
This report summarizes the results of quality assurance (QA) and user acceptance testing (UAT) performed in preparation for the 0.1.1 release of **Agentic Index**.

Testing was executed in a clean Python virtual environment using Python 3.12.10. Dependencies were installed from `requirements.txt` and the package was installed in editable mode.

## Test Execution
- **Automated tests** were executed using `pytest`.
- **Formatting checks** were run with `black` and `isort`.
- **CLI smoke test** attempted to run `agentic-index scrape`.

## Findings
### 1. Test Suite Failure
- `pytest` fails during collection because `tests/test_scrape_mock.py` references `responses` without importing it.
- Error output:
  ```
  NameError: name 'responses' is not defined
  ```
- This prevents the entire test suite from running.

### 2. Import Sorting Issues
- `isort --check-only .` reports unsorted imports in `tests/test_scrape_mock.py`.

### 3. CLI Network Access
- Running `agentic-index scrape` fails due to inability to connect to `api.github.com` when network access is restricted.
- Command output shows repeated retry warnings and eventually an error:
  ```
  Unknown error: Cannot connect to host api.github.com:443 ssl:default [Network is unreachable]
  ```

## Recommendations
1. **Fix tests/test_scrape_mock.py**
   - Add `import responses` at the top of the file.
   - Ensure imports are sorted to satisfy `isort`.
   - Re-run the test suite to confirm no further errors.
2. **Review CLI network handling**
   - Consider adding graceful handling for network failures or offline mode to improve user experience when internet access is unavailable.
3. **CI Improvements**
   - Integrate `black`, `isort`, and `pytest` checks in CI to catch issues before release.

## Conclusion
The 0.1.1 release requires fixes to the test suite and import sorting before release readiness. Addressing the above issues will allow the automated tests to run successfully and improve robustness of the CLI when network access is restricted.
