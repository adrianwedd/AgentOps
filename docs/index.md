# Agentic Index Documentation

Welcome to the Agentic Index documentation site. Here you'll find an overview of the project, usage instructions, and API reference material.

For a high-level view of module relationships, see the dependency diagrams in
[`docs/architecture`](architecture/README.md).

New contributors should start with the [ONBOARDING guide](ONBOARDING.md) which
explains how to launch the dev container via Codespaces or VS Code.
