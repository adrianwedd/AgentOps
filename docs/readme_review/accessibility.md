## Findings

*   **Alt Text for Images and Badges:**
    *   Most images (badges) have alt text (e.g., `![build](../../badges/build.svg)`).
    *   However, the alt text is often simplistic (e.g., "build", "coverage", "security") and could be more descriptive of the badge's meaning or the status it conveys (e.g., "Build status: passing", "Code coverage: 80%").
    *   Line 24: `![build](../../badges/build.svg)` - Alt text "build".
    *   Line 25: `![coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-80%25-brightgreen)` - Alt text "coverage".
    *   Line 26: `![security](https://img.shields.io/badge/security-0%20issues-brightgreen)` - Alt text "security".
    *   Line 27: `![docs](../../badges/docs.svg)` - Alt text "docs".
    *   Line 28: `![Site](https://img.shields.io/website?down_message=offline&up_message=online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fadrianwedd.github.io%2FAgentic-Index)` - Alt text "Site".
    *   Line 29: `![license](../../badges/license.svg)` - Alt text "license".
    *   Line 30: `![PyPI](../../badges/pypi.svg)` - Alt text "PyPI".
    *   Line 31: `![Release Notes](https://img.shields.io/github/release/adrianwedd/Agentic-Index?include_prereleases)` - Alt text "Release Notes".
    *   The alt text for `![System Architecture](../architecture.svg)` (Line 207) is good ("System Architecture").
    *   Alt text for footer badges (Line 298) like "Last Sync", "Top Repo", "Repo Count" are adequate.

*   **Meaningful Link Text:**
    *   Most link texts are descriptive and clearly indicate the destination (e.g., `[ðŸš€ Jump to Fast-Start Picks â†’](../../FAST_START.md)`, `[transparent scoring formula](#our-methodology--scoring-explained)`).
    *   Some links use file names or paths as text (e.g., `[SCHEMA.md](../SCHEMA.md)`), which is generally acceptable for a technical document.
    *   Critically, some links are just URLs, which are not very descriptive for screen reader users:
        *   Line 280: `[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)`
        *   Line 282: `[https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)`
    *   Footnote-style links like `[1, 2]` (e.g., Line 62) are not descriptive out of context, relying on surrounding text. While common in academic contexts, they can be challenging for accessibility if not handled carefully by assistive technologies.

*   **Language Identifiers in Code Blocks:**
    *   All `bash` code blocks correctly use the `bash` language identifier (e.g., Line 76, 211, 224). This is good for syntax highlighting and assistive technologies.

*   **Semantically Correct Markdown for Lists and Tables:**
    *   Lists (ordered and unordered) and tables are generally constructed using correct Markdown syntax. This helps ensure they are parsed and rendered semantically.
    *   Example: Unordered list starting Line 7, Table starting Line 15.

*   **Visual Inspection of Badge Color Contrast:**
    *   Shields.io badges with "brightgreen" background (e.g., coverage, security) typically have good contrast with white text.
    *   However, custom SVG badges (e.g., `../../badges/build.svg`, `../../badges/docs.svg`) require inspection of their internal SVG code or visual rendering to confirm color contrast. This cannot be done with the current tools. If text within these SVGs does not contrast sufficiently with its background, it would be a WCAG failure.

*   **Markdown Structure and Keyboard Navigation:**
    *   **Heading Structure**: As noted in a previous structural review, there's an H3 (`### Metrics Explained`) directly following an H1, skipping H2. Consistent heading hierarchy is important for screen reader navigation.
    *   **HTML Usage**:
        *   The use of `<details>` and `<summary>` (e.g., Line 145) is generally accessible and allows users to expand/collapse content.
        *   The use of `<a id="...">` (e.g., Line 55) to create link targets is acceptable and doesn't impede navigation.
        *   `<p align="center">` (Line 23) is presentational HTML. While not a direct navigation blocker, CSS is preferred for styling.

## Recommendations

*   **Alt Text for Images and Badges:**
    *   **(Medium Impact, Low Effort)** Enhance alt text for badges to be more descriptive. For example:
        *   `![Build status badge](../../badges/build.svg)`
        *   `![Code coverage: 80%](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-80%25-brightgreen)`
        *   `![Security: 0 issues detected](https://img.shields.io/badge/security-0%20issues-brightgreen)`
        *   `![Documentation status](../../badges/docs.svg)`
        *   `![Website status: online](https://img.shields.io/website?down_message=offline&up_message=online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fadrianwedd.github.io%2FAgentic-Index)`
        *   `![License: MIT](../../badges/license.svg)` (assuming MIT, update as per actual license badge)
        *   `![PyPI package version](../../badges/pypi.svg)`
        *   `![Latest GitHub release version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/adrianwedd/Agentic-Index?include_prereleases)`
    *   **(High Impact, Medium Effort - Requires SVG inspection)** For local SVG badges (`badges/*.svg`), ensure that any text within the SVGs has sufficient color contrast with its background (WCAG AA requires 4.5:1 for normal text). This may require editing the SVGs themselves.

*   **Meaningful Link Text:**
    *   **(High Impact, Low Effort)** Replace raw URL links with descriptive text:
        *   Line 280: Change `[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)` to `[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)`.
        *   Line 282: Change `[https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)` to `[MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)`.
    *   **(Low Impact, Medium Effort)** For footnote-style links (e.g., `[1, 2]`), consider if an alternative phrasing or linking method could make the purpose of the link clearer out of context, or ensure the surrounding text very clearly indicates the destination and purpose for users of assistive technologies. For this document, they mostly refer to the methodology document for specific claims, which is an acceptable academic style.

*   **Markdown Structure and Keyboard Navigation:**
    *   **(Medium Impact, Low Effort)** Correct heading hierarchy issues as identified in the structure review (e.g., change H3 `### Metrics Explained` to H2). This significantly aids keyboard navigation for users relying on jumping between headings.
    *   **(Low Impact, Low Effort)** Replace `<p align="center">` with CSS for centering if possible, though this is a minor issue.

*   **General Accessibility:**
    *   **(Medium Impact, Medium Effort)** If not already done, run an automated accessibility checker (like Axe or Pa11y) on the rendered HTML page where this README is displayed (e.g., on the GitHub repository page or any generated website). This can catch issues not obvious from the Markdown source, especially related to contrast and ARIA attributes injected by the rendering platform. The `Testing` section already mentions `pa11y` for `web/index.html`, which is excellent. Ensure this check covers the content from `README.md`.
