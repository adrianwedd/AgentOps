# Step 1: Reflect

Purpose: To take stock of the current state of the project and identify broad areas for improvement.

This step involves gathering information and forming a high-level understanding of the project's health and opportunities.

## Activities

1.  **List Core Artifacts**: Identify and list all essential components of the project. This typically includes:
    *   Source code files (e.g., Python modules, frontend components)
    *   Architectural documentation (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE.md`, diagrams)
    *   Task tracking (e.g., `tasks.yml`)
    *   Build and CI/CD configuration files (e.g., `Makefile`, `.github/workflows/`)
    *   Test suites and test data
    *   Key logs or reports generated by processes
    *   Dependency manifests (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`)

2.  **Summarize Current Metrics**: Collect and review key project metrics. The specific metrics will vary, but often include:
    *   **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by automated tests. (e.g., from `pytest-cov` reports, often found in CI logs or `coverage.xml`)
    *   **Linting Status**: Number and severity of lint errors. (e.g., from Flake8, ESLint output)
    *   **Dependency Versions**: Check for outdated dependencies. (e.g., `pip list --outdated`, Dependabot alerts, Snyk reports)
    *   **Recent Commit History**: Review recent commits to understand ongoing work, frequency of updates, and types of changes being made. (e.g., `git log --oneline -n 20`)
    *   **Open Issues/PRs**: Number and age of open issues and pull requests.
    *   **Security Vulnerabilities**: Number of known vulnerabilities. (e.g., Snyk, Trivy, Dependabot alerts)

3.  **Identify High-Level Gaps or Opportunities**: Based on the artifacts and metrics, identify 3-5 broad areas where the project could be improved. Examples include:
    *   Missing tests for critical modules.
    *   An outdated core dependency with known security issues.
    *   Architectural drift or increasing code complexity in a specific area.
    *   Lack of documentation for a new feature.
    *   Inefficient CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Opportunities to refactor repetitive code.

## Output

*   A shared understanding among the team of the current project state.
*   A list of 3-5 potential areas for improvement to be investigated further in the "Analyze" step.
