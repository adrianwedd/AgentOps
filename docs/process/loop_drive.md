# Step 7: Loop / Drive

Purpose: To formally conclude the current improvement cycle and initiate the next one, ensuring continuous progress.

This step transitions from documenting the completed work to preparing for the next iteration of improvements.

## Activities

1.  **Confirm Completion of Previous Steps**: Ensure that all activities in the "Execute", "Validate", and "Document" steps for the current cycle have been fully completed. This includes:
    *   Code changes committed and merged (or PR submitted/merged).
    *   Validation checks passed.
    *   `ARCHITECTURE.md` (if changed), `CHANGELOG.md`, and `tasks.yml` are all updated.

2.  **Increment Cycle Counter**: Mentally or formally note the next cycle number (e.g., if cycle `#{n}` just finished, the next cycle will be `#{n+1}`). This helps in tracking progress over time and in changelog entries.

3.  **Prepare for Next "Reflect" Step**:
    *   The "Loop / Drive" step naturally leads back to the "Reflect" step.
    *   The updated state of the project (after the current cycle's changes) becomes the input for the new "Reflect" phase.
    *   Any tasks added to `tasks.yml` as "follow-up" during the "Document" phase will be considered during the next "Decide" phase.

4.  **Continue Iteration**:
    *   Begin the next improvement cycle by re-running the **[Reflect](./reflect.md)** step.
    *   The process is continuous. The aim is to iterate through these seven steps regularly to maintain and improve the project's health and quality. The frequency of cycles can vary based on project needs and team capacity.

## Output

*   The current improvement cycle is formally closed.
*   The project is prepared for the next cycle of the self-improvement process, starting again with "Reflect".
*   A continuous improvement mindset is fostered within the team.
