# Step 3: Decide

Purpose: To select and prioritize a small number of actionable tasks based on the insights gathered during the "Reflect" and "Analyze" steps.

This step translates observations and identified issues into a concrete, ranked backlog for the current improvement cycle.

## Activities

1.  **Review Findings**: Go over the outputs from the "Reflect" (high-level gaps/opportunities) and "Analyze" (specific issues, test failures, vulnerabilities) steps.

2.  **Select Tasks**: Choose approximately 3-5 atomic tasks that address the most critical or impactful findings. Consider:
    *   **Severity and Impact**: Prioritize tasks that fix critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, or significantly improve performance/maintainability.
    *   **Effort**: Balance high-impact tasks with some potentially quicker wins.
    *   **Dependencies**: Understand if a task is blocked by another or is a prerequisite for future work.
    *   **Strategic Alignment**: Consider if the task aligns with broader project goals.

3.  **Define Tasks**: For each selected task, clearly define its scope and objective. Each task should be "atomic" â€“ small and focused enough to be completed within a reasonable timeframe by one person or a pair.

4.  **Prioritize Tasks**: Assign a priority to each task (e.g., 1-5, with 1 being the highest). This helps determine the order of execution.

5.  **Update `tasks.yml`**: Add the selected tasks to the `tasks.yml` file. Ensure each task entry includes the following fields, consistent with the existing structure:
    *   `id`: A unique integer for the task. Increment from the highest existing ID.
    *   `description`: A concise description of the task's goal.
    *   `component`: The primary area of the project the task relates to. Examples:
        *   `code`: Changes to application logic.
        *   `tests`: Adding or modifying test suites.
        *   `docs`: Updates to documentation.
        *   `deps`: Dependency updates or management.
        *   `ci`: Changes to CI/CD pipelines or configurations.
        *   `chore`: General maintenance or refactoring not fitting other categories.
    *   `dependencies`: A list of task `id`s that must be completed before this task can start. Use `[]` if there are no dependencies.
    *   `priority`: A numerical priority (e.g., 1-5).
    *   `status`: Initially, new tasks should have a status like `todo` or `pending`. (The current `tasks.yml` uses `done` for completed tasks; new tasks can be added without a status or with a `todo` status).

    Example entry in `tasks.yml`:
    ```yaml
    - id: 4
      description: "Fix critical vulnerability in `example-lib` by updating to v1.2.4"
      component: deps
      dependencies: []
      priority: 1
      # status: todo (or leave blank until work starts/completes)
    - id: 5
      description: "Refactor `complex_module.py` to reduce cyclomatic complexity of `process_data` function"
      component: code
      dependencies: []
      priority: 2
    - id: 6
      description: "Add unit tests for `new_feature_service.py`"
      component: tests
      dependencies: [5] # Example: if refactoring needs to happen first
      priority: 2
    ```

## Output

*   An updated `tasks.yml` file with a prioritized list of tasks for the current improvement cycle.
*   Clear, actionable goals for the "Execute" step.
