# Self-Improvement Process

This document outlines the iterative process used to continuously improve this project. The process consists of seven key steps, each detailed in its respective document:

1.  **[Reflect](./reflect.md)**: Take stock of the current project state, including core artifacts, metrics, and identify high-level gaps or opportunities.
2.  **[Analyze](./analyze.md)**: Perform static analysis (linting, complexity, vulnerabilities) and review test results to identify specific issues.
3.  **[Decide](./decide.md)**: Prioritize and select a small number of atomic tasks to address the findings from the Reflect and Analyze steps. These tasks are documented in `tasks.yml`.
4.  **[Execute](./execute.md)**: Implement the selected tasks, including code changes, dependency updates, and writing tests.
5.  **[Validate](./validate.md)**: Ensure the changes are correct by running tests and scans, confirming no new issues have been introduced.
6.  **[Document](./document.md)**: Update relevant project documentation, including `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `tasks.yml`.
7.  **[Loop / Drive](./loop_drive.md)**: Conclude the current cycle and begin the next by returning to the Reflect step.

This structured approach helps ensure consistent progress, maintainability, and quality of the project over time.
