# End-to-End Pipeline Validation for 0.1.1

This note records an attempt to execute the full refresh pipeline using `scripts/refresh_category.py`.

```bash
python scripts/refresh_category.py Experimental --output temp_data
```

The command failed because the environment could not reach `api.github.com`:

```
Request error: Cannot connect to host api.github.com:443 ssl:default [Network is unreachable]; retrying in 1.0 seconds
```

This confirms that the pipeline requires network access to fetch repository data. Without internet access the refresh step cannot proceed.

All other tests pass locally using fixture data.
