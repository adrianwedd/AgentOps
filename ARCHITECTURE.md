# Project Architecture

This repository is organized into two main packages:

- `agentic_index_cli` – command line utilities for validating and ranking repositories
- `agentic_index_api` – REST API exposing ranking and metadata

See `docs/architecture` for generated diagrams (`scripts/gen_arch_diagrams.py`).

## Self-Improvement Process
