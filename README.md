# 🤖 AgentOps: The Ultimate Index of Open-Source AI Agent Frameworks

Welcome to **AgentOps**, the definitive, developer-focused catalogue of autonomous AI tooling.
Here you’ll find **scored and curated repositories** that power LLM agents, multi-agent systems, RAG pipelines, devtools, and more.

Unlike star-count lists or stale awesome-pages, **AgentOps is data-driven**, refreshed monthly, and optimized for action.

We rank everything using a transparent scoring formula based on:

  * 🌟 Stars & momentum
  * 🔧 Maintenance & issue health
  * 📚 Docs & examples
  * 🧠 Ecosystem fit
  * 📅 Recency
  * ⚖️ Licensing

> **🎯 TL;DR:** This isn’t just a list—it’s your launchpad for building with AI agents.

## ✨ Why AgentOps is Different

In the fast-moving world of Agentic-AI, finding high-quality, actively maintained, and truly impactful frameworks can be a pain. Many lists are subjective or just track stars. AgentOps cuts through the noise with an analytical approach:

  * **Systematic Scoring:** Every repo gets crunched through our [transparent scoring formula](#our-methodology--scoring-explained). We look at real signals: community traction (stars [1, 2]), development activity (commit recency [1, 2]), maintenance health (issue management [3, 4]), documentation quality, license permissiveness [1, 2], and ecosystem integration.[1, 5] No black boxes.
  * **Focus on Builder Tools:** We spotlight frameworks, toolkits, and platforms that *actually help you build and orchestrate AI agents*. Check our [scope definition](./docs/methodology.md) for the nitty-gritty.
  * **Relentlessly Fresh:** Data gets a refresh monthly (or sooner if big shifts happen). Stale lists suck. Our [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) keeps score.
  * **Automated Vigilance:** A GitHub Action keeps an eye on things weekly, flagging big score or rank changes for review. This keeps the "freshness" promise real.
  * **Open & Transparent:** Our entire [methodology](./docs/methodology.md) – data sources, scoring weights, the lot – is out in the open. Trust through transparency.

AgentOps is built to be a reliable, data-driven launchpad for your next Agentic-AI project.

\<details\>
\<summary\>🔬 Our Methodology & Scoring Explained (Click to Expand)\</summary\>

AgentOps believes in full transparency. Here’s the lowdown on how we find, vet, and score repositories.

The core AgentOps Scoring Formula:
`Score = 0.35*log2(stars+1) + 0.20*recency_factor + 0.15*issue_health + 0.15*doc_completeness + 0.10*license_freedom + 0.05*ecosystem_integration`\<sup\>†\</sup\>

\<sup\>†\</sup\> *Weights are reviewed and potentially tuned quarterly. Full math and reasoning in [`/docs/methodology.md`](./docs/methodology.md).*

**Quick Look at Components:**

  * **Seed Discovery:** GitHub searches (e.g., `"agent framework"`, `"LLM agent"`), topic filters (e.g., `topic:agent` [17]), and crawling curated lists [24, 25, 7] to cast a wide net.
  * **Metadata Harvest:** Pulling key data: stars, forks, open/closed issues, commit dates, language, license, README snippets. (Examples: [13, 1, 12, 26, 23, 2, 10, 8, 3, 14, 15, 16, 19, 22, 27, 28] and many others as detailed in `docs/methodology.md`)
  * **Quality & Activity Scoring:** The formula balances community buzz, dev activity, maintenance, docs, license, and how well it plays with others.
  * **De-duplication & Categorisation:** Forks usually get skipped unless they’re their own thing now. Repos get bucketed by their main gig.

For the full, unabridged version, see **[./docs/methodology.md](./docs/methodology.md)**.
