title: Automate dependency installation
category: Enhancement
priority: P0
effort: 5
rationale: |
  Missing packages like `aiohttp` caused test failures during the audit.
  Automating installation would ensure a consistent environment.
description: |
  - Create a setup script or package manager configuration that installs all required Python packages.
  - Validate that new contributors can run `pytest` without missing dependencies.
acceptance_criteria:
  - `pytest` runs without ImportError exceptions on a fresh clone.

title: Improve network error handling tests
category: Enhancement
priority: P1
effort: 3
rationale: |
  Collection scripts fail when network calls break. Better unit tests will surface these issues early.
description: |
  - Add mock-based tests for modules in `agentic_index_cli.network`.
  - Include scenarios for timeouts and API failures.
acceptance_criteria:
  - New tests cover at least 80% of `agentic_index_cli.network` functions.

title: Provide containerized development environment
category: Enhancement
priority: P1
effort: 8
rationale: |
  A Docker-based workflow would eliminate manual setup and reduce onboarding friction.
description: |
  - Create a Dockerfile with all dependencies and environment variables.
  - Document usage in README.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Developers can run `docker compose up` and execute CLI commands immediately.

title: Document required environment variables
category: Documentation
priority: P0
effort: 1
rationale: |
  Users are unaware of necessary tokens like `GITHUB_TOKEN_REPO_STATS` and `API_KEY`.
description: |
  - Add a section in README describing required variables and their purpose.
  - Link to example `.env` file.
acceptance_criteria:
  - README includes clear setup steps for environment variables.

title: Add caching to reduce network calls
category: Enhancement
priority: P2
effort: 5
rationale: |
  Scraping and API calls are repeated frequently and may hit rate limits. Caching will speed up runs.
description: |
  - Implement optional caching layer in `agentic_index_cli.network` using on-disk JSON or a lightweight DB.
  - Provide CLI flag to enable or clear cache.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Running scrape twice uses cached results and reduces API calls.

title: Audit secrets and token usage
category: Governance
priority: P2
effort: 3
rationale: |
  Token handling lacks security review; sensitive keys may leak in logs or history.
description: |
  - Review how environment variables are loaded and used.
  - Ensure tokens are not logged or committed.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Documented guidelines for secure token handling.

title: Integrate Dependabot or similar tool
category: Enhancement
priority: P2
effort: 3
rationale: |
  Keeping dependencies current mitigates security risks and prevents missing features.
description: |
  - Add configuration for an automated dependency update service.
  - Monitor update PRs for successful tests.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Dependency update PRs are created automatically and pass CI.

title: Review contribution guidelines for clarity
category: Documentation
priority: P1
effort: 2
rationale: |
  Clear contribution policies improve community engagement and align with Mozilla OSS guidelines.
description: |
  - Audit `CONTRIBUTING.md` for missing sections on code style and PR workflow.
  - Provide examples for common tasks.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Updated CONTRIBUTING guide with explicit steps and references to style checks.
