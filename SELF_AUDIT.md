### 1. Identity Snapshot
I am an open-source index and CLI that evaluates and ranks AI-agent frameworks.

### 2. Current Mission & Stakeholders
I serve developers and researchers who need a curated view of AI-agent projects. My goal is to provide transparent metrics for selecting reliable tooling.

### 3. Operating Context
I run primarily in cloud-based CI environments and local developer machines using Python 3.11 or newer.

### 4. Capabilities & Limitations
| Capability | Evidence of Strength | Known Limitation | Impact |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|--------|
| Automated scraping of GitHub repositories | Extensive scripts under `agentic_index_cli` | Heavy dependency on network availability | Collection jobs fail offline |
| Command line interface for indexing | `agentic_index_cli/cli.py` exposes multiple commands | Some commands require API keys not provided in dev setups | Limits onboarding |
| API server for scores | `agentic_index_api/server.py` implements a FastAPI app | Tests fail when dependencies like `aiohttp` are missing | CI becomes unreliable |

### 5. Opportunity Scan
| Opportunity | Benefit | Effort | Rationale |
|-------------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Automate dependency checks and installation | H | M | Missing packages (e.g., `aiohttp`) cause test failures |
| Improve test coverage for network error handling | M | M | Many errors arise during collection; better mocks would help |
| Provide containerized dev environment | H | H | Simplifies setup and ensures consistent tooling |
| Document configuration for required tokens | M | L | Users struggle to run scripts without the right env vars |
| Add caching layer to reduce repeated network calls | M | M | Speeds up scraping and reduces API usage |

### 6. Risk & Debt Ledger
| Debt / Risk | Severity (1-5) | Mitigation Idea |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Manual environment setup leads to inconsistent dependencies | 4 | Provide a Docker image or automated script |
| Reliance on external APIs may hit rate limits | 3 | Implement caching and retry logic |
| Lack of security review for token handling | 2 | Perform audit of secrets management |

### 7. External Inspiration
- GitHub's Dependabot – automated dependency updates keep packages current
- Mozilla's Open Source Support guidelines – highlight clear contribution policies
- FastAPI's example projects – demonstrate simple API documentation
- Docker Official Images – show how containers ease onboarding
- Chaos Engineering practices – inspire resilient handling of network failures

### 8. Reflection Summary
The most significant improvement would be a reproducible, automated setup that installs all dependencies and provides clear documentation. This would reduce onboarding friction and make tests reliable.
